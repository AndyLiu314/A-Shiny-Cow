# Interactive Phong Shader
## Made By: Andy Liu

**Instructions To Run:** 
Download the project as a zip file. Unzip the folder and open the HTML file in your preferred browser. The program should work on the latest stable version of Chrome. 

However, if it does not run, try creating a localhost server and opening the HTML file through that. I ran my file by selecting "Start Server Logging" in the VSCode Command Palette and then copying the link provided into "Debug: Open Link" (also in the Command Palette).

**Overview of Controls:** 
Left click and drag controls X and Y translation while the up and down arrow keys controls Z translation. Right click and drag controls the rotation around the X and Y axes while Z rotations are controlled by the left and right arrows. Pressing 'r' will reset the position of the cow and pressing 'p' stops the rotation of the point light. The "switch shading" button will switch between flat and phong shading techniques.
